# CantmeraOS

The Can't-mera is a Raspberry Pi based camera in a 3D printed frame that intentionally lacks a viewfinder or preview screen in order to intervene in the photographic process. It exists also as a pedagogical device for new photographers to train the mind's eye and get over the fear of pressing the shutter button. The camera tweets photos to twitter, either at the end of a "roll" or, in the case of an art gallery exhibit, after each photograph.

## Artist Statement

The Can’t-mera project intends to serve as an intervention in the ways that digital camera technology influences approaches to modern photography, particularly reliance on the ability to “preview” or “edit” work toward popular convention. As a response to these conventions, the Can’t-mera is a device similar to the traditional SLR camera, that intentionally lacks a viewfinder or screen. A camera designed without the ability to frame a photo forces the photographer to trust their vision by emulating a film experience, in that the photos cannot be previewed before they are developed. In addition, the camera forces all photos to be “tweeted” out publicly on the Twitter social media platform in order to be viewed thus placing the photographer in the same role as the viewer, giving a new perspective to their own work. Together the project will interact with the idea of the self-editor by removing that ability from the artist. It interacts with technology’s role in photography and examines its influence and whether technology is inherently non-human or if it can exist without interfering in the human process of photography. Furthermore, it questions honesty in photography, whether that’s achievable, as well as identity in so far as cultural and gender identity, within the bounds of technical and conceptual clarity.

## What is this repository

This repository contains source code for the display of the Can't-mera's twitter feed in the art gallery showing.
